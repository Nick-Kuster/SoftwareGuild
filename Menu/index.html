<td>Come on down to Hope's diner where you and the whole family can enjoy
a nice friendly meal. We understand that you may have just had a tough day
trying to learn something new... coding perhaps? If you're getting discouraged and are thinking, "Gee
Golly, this might be too much to handle."--Just remember--there's always Hope's!</td>
